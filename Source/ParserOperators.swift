// Combine multiple parsers so that they run one after the other and produce a combined result.

/**
 Sequential Application Operator (Apply).
 
 Combine multiple parsers so that the function within one is applied to the parameter given within the other parser. The resulting parser is returned.
 
 Discussion: This method is a core concept within the parser conbinator. The first parmeter of this function contains a parser which maps from one type to another. This function is applied to the secondary parameter and the result is returned. Adding this operator means that the parser can be classified as an applicative functor.
 
 - parameter left: A parser which contains a transform function from one type to another.
 
 - parameter right: The parser that is the subject of the transform.
 
 - returns: A parser of the type given after the transform function is complete.

 Optional Sequential Application Operator.

 Discussion: In the case that an optional nil is sent to the second parameter then this will be mapped to a result.

 Map Operator
 
 Apply a mapping function to the parser. Creating a parser of a different type. Reverses the syntax of applying a map using a function. The map transform is first, then the value to be mapped.
