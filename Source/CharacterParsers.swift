/**
 A convienience method to make a parser for type "Character".
 
 A simple closure is supplied which describes a boolean result of if a character should match. 
 The parser runs the closure and uses it to assess if the character is successful.
 The character assessed by the composer will be consumed by it and subtracted from the token stream.
 
 - parameter condition: A closure which takes the character and returns a boolean result of its is parsability.
 
 - returns: The parser with the same semantic as the closure given.
